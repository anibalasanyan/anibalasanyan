## ✈️ Featured Projects
### 🔹 Amadeus SkyWORKS  
Desktop suite enabling real-time flight scheduling and operations for global airlines.  
*Tech: : C#, MongoDB, OOP, Git, WPF, Microservices, REST APIs, Message Queues 
(RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ), Unit/Integration testing*
###🔹 Gantt Chart Backend Infrastructure
Role: Backend Engineer
Tech Stack: C#, .NET, MongoDB, GraphQL, Microservices

Designed and implemented the backend infrastructure powering a high-performance Gantt chart visualization tool for real-time scheduling. This system supports:

Grouping and sorting of segments by flight, aircraft, or user-defined keys

Time-based filtering for optimal performance on large datasets

Support for both REST and GraphQL APIs

Paginated and structured delivery of GanttItem and GanttGroup DTOs

📌 Result: Enabled dynamic, scalable timeline rendering across millions of flight segments and optimized backend query performance through aggregation and caching strategies.

###🔹 Slots into Schedule
Role: System Integrator & Backend Developer
Tech Stack: C#, MongoDB, Microservices

Integrated airport slot management into flight schedules by modeling slots as special segment objects. Key contributions:

Defined slot types (departure, arrival, turnaround) and their relationships to flight legs

Created logic to detect slot mismatches and generate warnings

Enhanced the scheduling UI with visual feedback based on slot validation

📌 Result: Improved airline compliance with airport slot constraints and supported operational planning with clear, slot-aware visualizations.

###🔹 Understanding Index Set
Role: Data Architect
Tech Stack: C#, MongoDB

Developed the IndexSet abstraction for grouping related schedule data (e.g., segments, violations, publications) by key identifiers such as aircraft or flight number. Contributions include:

Standardizing grouped data access across microservices

Designing a flexible structure to support custom views in Gantt charts

Improving backend efficiency by pre-grouping data for visualization and filtering

📌 Result: Simplified data querying and improved consistency in time-based visual components across the scheduling platform.

###🔹 Segment Comments
Role: Feature Owner & Functional Designer
Tech Stack: C#, MongoDB, SSIM integration

Designed a flexible comment system allowing airlines to attach metadata to specific flight segments. Features include:

Support for direct, nonstop, and connecting itinerary comments

User-defined fields (traffic restrictions, meal codes, terminal notes)

Import/export using SSIM standards

Rule-based and persistent storage strategies for comment handling

📌 Result: Provided airlines with a robust way to annotate itineraries, improving ticketing accuracy and operational communication.

###🔹 Publication Rules for Segments
Role: Rules Engine Developer
Tech Stack: C#, .NET, Domain-Specific Logic

Implemented the SegmentRules engine for controlling when and how flight segments are published to external systems. Key highlights:

On-demand virtual segment generation for rule evaluation

Use of FilterBuilder, FilterConverter, and FilterCriteria for flexible filtering

Resolved edge cases where segments did not yet exist in the backend by generating virtual models

📌 Result: Enabled precise control over segment visibility and scheduling workflows, improving rule-based decision automation and reducing manual oversight.
